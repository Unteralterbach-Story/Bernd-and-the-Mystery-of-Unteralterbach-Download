## 🧠 Overview  

**Bernd and the Mystery of Unteralterbach** is a narrative-focused indie title that immerses players in a bizarre village full of odd traditions, uncomfortable silences, and unexpected humor. The game unfolds through exploration and dialogue, gradually revealing a mystery that feels both absurd and unsettling.

Rather than guiding players with explicit objectives, the experience encourages curiosity and attention to detail. Conversations can shift tone without warning, blending irony, satire, and subtle psychological tension. The world feels intentionally off-balance, inviting interpretation rather than clear answers.

This adventure is crafted for players who appreciate unconventional storytelling, where atmosphere and character interactions carry more weight than mechanics.
